<h1 class="nonInverted">About Minified</h1>

<p>Call me old-fashioned, but the size of JavaScript libraries like jQuery and MooTools has always bothered me. 
Don't get me wrong, they are fantastic libraries and I really like to use them, but they contain about 90kb of code even after minification. 
This code needs to be parsed and executed on every page that you include them on.  For me, that just feels too large for what that they offer, 
and especially for what I need. The 30kb size that they have after gzipping will can also cause a significant delay on low-bandwidth networks.
</p><p>
In the last years I worked on some personal projects (only <a href="http://timjansen.github.io/jarfiller/">jarfiller.org</a> has been published).
When I work on them, I usually strive for perfection. Every unnecessary kilobyte hurts.  So instead of using jQuery, I started writing my own 
little helper functions to replace jQuery functionality without the overhead. As I worked on several other projects, I wrote more and more helper 
functions and started sharing them between projects until they became a library of their own.  By now they are so mature that I believe that this 
library, called Minified, became a valid alternative to jQuery and MooTools at a fraction of the size.
